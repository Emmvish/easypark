EasyPark - IoT based Smart Parking Manager

The EasyPark - Smart Parking System project was originally validated against the following requirements:

1. Provision of at least 8 parking slots in the parking lot, distributed between two floors.

2. Automation of the Entry Gate as well as the Exit Gate of the parking lot.

3. Incorporation of a Billing System, that accepts duration of parking of a vehicle inside lot as a parameter and generates the bill based on any chosen criterion.

4. Allocation a free parking slot, which is closest to the Entrance of the lot – at any given time, to the vehicle drivers at the entrance.

5. Installation of LEDs on the outside wall of each parking slot to indicate whether a vehicle is parked in that slot or not.

6. Presence of a Login system for the parking operator to authorize him/her before the above mentioned functionality of the lot can be utilized.

7. Provision of “Help” switches at every parking spot, so that any handicapped people can be easily taken care of by the parking staff.

8. Provision of a safety system featuring smoke detection, fire alarms, emergency gate and emergency ramp.

9. Search for a particular vehicle using its vehicle number inside the list of currently parked vehicles, to obtain its slot number.

10. Usage of an LCD at Entrance to print the assigned slot number and an LCD at the Exit to display the bill amount.

11. Provision of Valets for convenient car parking.
